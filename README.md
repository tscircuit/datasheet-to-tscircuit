# Datasheet to tscircuit

A Bun + React application that accepts a component datasheet, runs
[`tsci-agent`](https://github.com/tscircuit/tsci-agent) in a per-job
workspace, streams the full agent process output, builds the generated TSX with
`tsci`, and previews the resulting Circuit JSON with the same
[`@tscircuit/runframe`](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe) surface used by
tscircuit.com.

## Run locally with Docker

The recommended demo runs the web app, API, `tsci-agent`, and `tsci` together
inside one local container. Install Docker Desktop and the `tsci` CLI, then
authenticate on the host:

```bash
tsci login
cp .env.example .env
tsci auth print-token
```

Paste the printed token into `.env` as `TSCIRCUIT_JWT`. The file is ignored by
Git and excluded from the Docker build context. Then build the image:

```bash
mkdir -p .runtime
bun run build
```

After the image has built successfully, start the application:

```bash
bun start
```

The startup entrypoint prepares the bind-mounted `.runtime` directory and then
drops privileges before running the server as the non-root `bun` user. To test
that behavior without starting the server, run:

```bash
bun run test:docker
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Compose publishes the port on host loopback only,
so it is not reachable from other machines. Generated PDFs, TSX, Circuit JSON,
and `agent.log` files persist under `.runtime/jobs` after the container stops.

Stop the application with:

```bash
bun run stop
```

## Develop without Docker

```bash
bun install
tsci login
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The API runs on `http://localhost:3000` and is
proxied by Vite. Direct server execution binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Set
`HOST` or `PORT` to override the bind address or port, and set `TSCI_AGENT_BIN`
or `TSCI_BIN` to override the discovered local executables.

## How jobs work

Each upload gets its own directory under `.runtime/jobs`. The server writes the
PDF and a small tscircuit project scaffold there, then executes:

```bash
tsci-agent do --prompt "..." --dir .runtime/jobs/<job_id>
```

Both stdout and stderr are streamed to the browser and persisted to
`agent.log`. The current `tsci-agent` event renderer already reports agent,
turn, tool, retry, compaction, assistant-text, and thinking events, so a separate
`--log-file` flag is not required.

The server also checkpoints task metadata to `job.json` and model-run state to
`spice/model-run.json`. At startup it scans `.runtime/jobs` and restores every
recoverable task, log, generated component, model checkpoint, and preview. A run
that was interrupted by the restart is shown as failed and can be retried from
its preserved files. Deleting a task removes its in-memory component/model jobs
and its complete `.runtime/jobs/<job_id>` directory, so it does not return after
the next restart.

After the agent exits successfully, the server runs `tsci build` and returns the
generated `index.circuit.tsx` and Circuit JSON to the browser.

The New Task form can also launch a PSpice model run with a 1×, 2×, 4×, or 8×
effort budget. Model creation is enabled by default, and the toggle/effort choice
is retained locally for the next task. Its setup agent starts alongside component conversion and extracts
datasheet curves, provenance, and benchmark references without consuming the
effort budget. If setup finishes first, the model run waits for the authoritative
component pinout. The refinement timer starts only after that component is
available; higher effort uses the same locked benchmarks and scoring process for
more refinement iterations.

Model work is stored under `.runtime/jobs/<job_id>/spice`. The server owns the
numeric benchmark scorer, reruns every generated tscircuit analog test bench, and
keeps the best checkpointed model when time expires. The model tab streams
structured progress checkpoints live, including datasheet/graph evidence counts,
the active benchmark, iteration number, and current champion score, alongside the
complete agent log. As benchmark TSX and numeric evidence appear, the server
builds a live runframe and plots the reference curve with the current model result.
Candidate CSVs written by the agent are not trusted for final scoring or display:
the server reruns each analog circuit, rejects Circuit JSON simulation errors,
extracts probe graphs into hashed `results/verified` CSVs, and scores and plots
only those verified files. The preview dropdown switches the circuit and its paired reference/result curve
together. SPICE runframes expose only Analog Simulation, Code, and Schematic, with
Analog Simulation selected initially. A failed validation pass is sent back to
the agent for another correction pass until every locked benchmark passes or the
effort budget ends; timed-out runs still expose the latest checkpoint. Reference and model-result traces use
complementary dash phases so both remain visible when their values overlap.
The canonical or last promoted model is published before bounded independent
validation, so a validation timeout cannot hide an available checkpoint. A
successfully built model wrapper is attached back to the generated component.
Set `MODEL_BASE_EFFORT_MS` to change the local duration represented by 1× effort
(30 minutes by default). Refinement and independent validation share that effort
window; reference setup and waiting for the component remain untimed.

The task sidebar can start and monitor multiple conversions concurrently. Each
job has an independent process group and cancel control, so stopping one task
does not interrupt other agents or the application container.

## Security and hosting

The local Docker container is the current process and filesystem isolation
boundary. It runs as a non-root user, drops Linux capabilities, and mounts only
`.runtime` from this repository. The agent still has outbound network access,
the `TSCIRCUIT_JWT` credential, and write access to generated job files, so this
configuration is for a trusted local operator and must not be exposed as a
public upload service.

The image includes Poppler so the agent can extract datasheet text with
`pdftotext` and render pinout or mechanical-drawing pages with `pdftoppm` before
generating the component.

Long-term hosted deployment should move authentication, durable job state,
storage, quotas, and sandbox orchestration into a separate private backend. That
hosted backend is intentionally outside the scope of this local demo.
